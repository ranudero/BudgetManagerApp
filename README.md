# BudgetManagerApp

## Description
This repository is my answer to the Budget Manager challenge at Hyperskill. The code is just one way of answering the questions, stages and challenges the lab requires. I do not own the rights to the Lab itself, but I do represent a way of solving the stages.

## Task 1 objective
First, let’s implement the counting of your purchases. It’s much easier to analyze when your expenses are presented as a list. Read data from the console and at the end show the list of all purchases and its total amount.
It should be displayed as follows: Total: $23.00

For this i have created the Analyzer class to handle the purchases and the main class to handle the user input.

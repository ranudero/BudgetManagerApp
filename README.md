# BudgetManagerApp

## Description
This repository is my answer to the Budget Manager challenge at Hyperskill. The code is just one way of answering the questions, stages and challenges the lab requires. I do not own the rights to the Lab itself, but I do represent a way of solving the stages.

## Task 1 objective
First, let’s implement the counting of your purchases. It’s much easier to analyze when your expenses are presented as a list. Read data from the console and at the end show the list of all purchases and its total amount.
It should be displayed as follows: Total: $23.00

For this i have created the Analyzer class to handle the purchases and the main class to handle the user input.

## Task 2 objective
A menu is added to create flexibility and functionality. The menu consist out of 5 items:
1. Add income
2. Add purchase
3. Show list of purchases
4. Balance
5. Exit

For this i have created the MainMenu class to handle the menu.
The TransactionManager class is created to handle the transactions and the balance.
